# Healthcare Services Management App

This is a simple React web application that allows users to manage and display a list of healthcare services. Users can add, update, and delete services, with built-in form validation to ensure all fields are filled before submission. The application is styled using the **Tailwind CSS** framework.

## Features

- **Add Services**: Users can input service details such as name, price, and description, and add new services to the list.
- **Update Services**: Existing services can be edited and updated.
- **Delete Services**: Users can remove services from the list.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all required fields (name, price, description) are filled before allowing a service to be added.
- **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: The application uses the Tailwind CSS framework for responsive and modern styling.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component state.
